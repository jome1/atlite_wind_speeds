The notebook shows a workaround to aggregate wind-speeds instead of generation timeseries to custom regions with atlite.

## 0. Setup
__a) clone the repository:__

`https://github.com/jome1/atlite_wind_speeds.git`

After cloning, navigate to the top-level folder of the repo.

__b) install python dependencies__

⚠️ the python environment has not been tested yet ⚠️ (normal atlite environment should work)

The Python package requirements are in the `requirements.yaml` file. You can install these requirements in a new environment using `conda`:

`conda env create -f envs/requirements.yaml`

Then activate this new environment using

`conda activate atlite_wind_speeds`
